Subset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================
Version 1.0
-----------

This dataset is sourced from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphonr Dataset Version 1.0 gathered by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto (activityrecognition@smartlab.ws, www.smartlab.ws).

These extract is based on the cached version of the original dataset available at "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip". Only mean and standard deviation features were extracted from the original dataset.

The below is an excerpt from the original description of the experiment, provided by the authors:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details."
